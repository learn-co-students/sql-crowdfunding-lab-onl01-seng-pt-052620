-- In this lab, you have two tasks - first, you will need to create three tables in lib/create.sql, and populate them with data in lib/insert.sql. Then, you will need to write the necessary SQL statements inside the methods in lib/sql_queries.rb that would allow you to query data from your newly created tables.

-- Create New Table, Records and Queries
-- Now we're going to create a schema based on the following information:

-- A project has a title, a category, a funding goal, a start date, and an end date.
-- A user has a name and an age
-- A pledge has an amount. It belongs to a user, and it also belongs to a project.
-- Create the Tables
-- In the create.sql file, model your tables. You should have a table for projects, users, and pledges.

-- Insert Records into Database
-- Within the insert.sql file, insert 10 projects, 20 users, and 30 pledges into the database.

-- Write the Queries
-- Write SQL queries as strings in lib/sql_queries in each of the provided methods.

-- Run learn as you go and read the test messages for additional guidance.
